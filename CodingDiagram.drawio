The reality is that &lt;br&gt;there is a problem with leadership. There needs to be one leader&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;who provides a clear waste management strategy and who has &lt;br&gt;control. A designated group should be in charge of the whole, so&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;everyone listens to one person rather than depending on separate&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;people because everyone has different preferences. One of the&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;problems is that the LWMA and MEECC do not coordinate with&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;external parties. The ministry and LWMA’s preferences for &lt;br&gt;strategies and operations are affected by external factors. For &lt;br&gt;example:&amp;nbsp;when trying to get things done, the agenda is influenced &lt;br&gt;by big projects since that’s where the money is. The LWMA has to&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;go along with the big projects even if it interrupts project the &lt;br&gt;LWMA because the external parties provide a limited window so&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;other projects get pushed aside or delayed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question 3:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;E-waste collection should be tried and needs to get more attention.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Implementation should happen on a country level. A lot of people &lt;br&gt;would be willing to put in the effort, but the conditions for it need to&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;be created. Almost half the population would be willing to &lt;br&gt;participate in an e-waste system and want a better system and a &lt;br&gt;more sustainable environment. The population of the Seychelles&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;do not think that differently about the environment than the rest of&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;the world. There needs to be the proper conditions for participation&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;such as information for households about the system and how to&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;participate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;E-waste is needed, but there needs to be an outlet and a group&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;dedicated with operating the system. Separate bins need to be &lt;br&gt;provided. A levy tax to support the activity should be feasible to &lt;br&gt;fund the cost of manpower and operations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An outlet is needed or else the e-waste is just dumped. Discussing&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;with the ministry the way forward with proposals to address very &lt;br&gt;basic barriers like aligning priorities and implementing the right &lt;br&gt;conditions. One of the biggest criticisms about data is that it’s not &lt;br&gt;good. The compilations were hard for Nina, since she had go &lt;br&gt;around searching for data. Reliable information is needed to make&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;an informed decision. The condition needs to be right. Decisions &lt;br&gt;have to be made on facts not opinions. Problem because currently&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;people use opinions too often to make decisions in waste &lt;br&gt;management. The budget is structured with an emphasis on waste &lt;br&gt;services, which is due to the economy being based on tourism. But&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;the focus should not just be on services, but also on the facility &lt;br&gt;and collection points since there needs to be the capacity to reach &lt;br&gt;targets. Bio-waste is a large part of waste, so more capacity is &lt;br&gt;needed. The way waste is structured needs to be considered in&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;order to structure around the needs of the whole system. The &lt;br&gt;structure should be based on information, not opinions or whims or&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;rumors. It is important to get information right and priorities &lt;br&gt;straight. People tend to think that the system is more expensive&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;than what is needed to begin. People need to understand their &lt;br&gt;role in the system. There are compilations available from 2019, but&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;the goal of the 2020 compilations is to be more detailed. More &lt;br&gt;information is needed on imports. A better information system is &lt;br&gt;desired, and it should not be too expensive. The distribution of &lt;br&gt;population density is needed to position the collection centers were&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;population is most concentrated rather than the current system &lt;br&gt;where the centers are placed wherever an opportunity arises. The&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;LWMA is trying to push forward to come to solutions, introduce &lt;br&gt;better technology, and work on big ideas. Most think that the &lt;br&gt;simplest solution is have a full energy plant or incineration plant, &lt;br&gt;and that it would solve all the problems overnight; however, the &lt;br&gt;people need to better understand the logistics and scientific &lt;br&gt;knowledge to see that multiple channels are required. E-waste &lt;br&gt;must be diverted from general waste even with an incineration &lt;br&gt;plant. Implementing multiple waste channels is the direction that &lt;br&gt;the Seychelles should go. Separating waste is very important. &lt;br&gt;The first steps in implementing an e-waste system should be&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;achievable such as starting a separate waste channel. People&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;need to be influenced in order to know what is possible.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The LWMA is currently pushing a new project to do more separation by the source (pre-sorting by households). The goal is&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;to transform the waste collection system for the whole country.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;The conversation should include everyone in the country. In the&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;past, there were discussions about recycling, but no instructions &lt;br&gt;were laid out. Waste collection needs be individualized and door to&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;door information should be provided to people. One question that&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;need be asked is: “What can we start now?” Discussions to&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;transform people’s perspective on waste and cleanliness need to&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;occur. There have been discussions about it being too expensive,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;but there needs to be a push to just start and then progress and&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;refine the system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The financial mechanism funds those in charge whether it be a &lt;br&gt;private collector or government contractor. It needs a separate &lt;br&gt;channel to be processed. Even a small, local company should be &lt;br&gt;able to operate such a system, and a few are already willing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question 4:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A household fee has not been done yet, but taxes and levies at the&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;point of entry are common. The possibility of having those who &lt;br&gt;place the products on the market bear the cost should be explored.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;The levy should be across the board so that the inflow of funds &lt;br&gt;does not fluctuate depending on the ups and downs of imports. &lt;br&gt;The mechanism would be better if it is more consistent. There are &lt;br&gt;hundreds of importers so it would be difficult to implement a &lt;br&gt;system where each is taxed, therefore, an across the board levy&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;regardless of import levels should be implemented.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question 5:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attitudes are much more willing to accept invisible &lt;br&gt;mechanism such as a levy but want transparency as to where&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;the money goes. Many would want to opt out of a fee. The &lt;br&gt;system would be better with a fee at the point of entry, so &lt;br&gt;people don’t perceive it. The residents cannot change it then, &lt;br&gt;so they will adapt to it has it goes through the course of &lt;br&gt;people (down from a fee on importers to a higher price offered&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;by retailers to customers). That way people can’t evade it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;783&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse ; width: 587pt&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 115.2pt&quot;&gt;  &lt;td height=&quot;154&quot; class=&quot;xl65&quot; width=&quot;783&quot; style=&quot;height: 115.2pt ; width: 587pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;" style="rounded=0;html=1;horizontal=1;whiteSpace=wrap;align=left;" parent="dNxyNK7c78bLwvsdeMH5-11" vertex="1">
